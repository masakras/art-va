   <p>"The name of young and talented artist Alexander Vasilevich from Grodno is more and more often heard in exhibition announcements not only in Belarus but abroad. Alexander is a versatile Belarusian artist, who works in oil, watercolours, gouache, graphic arts. He is a portraitist painting in his own inimitable style.  Who is an artist?  A person who doesn`t think in real terms, doesn`t transfer and copy what he sees, but creatively processes and makes his special sign system, Art language.</p>
    <p>Emotional pictures of this author charm and surprise. The artist bravely and masterly puts up his thoughts and feelings into every work. It has become exponential for the author to change the directions of creative work and surprise with inexhaustive richness of plots and ideas. I find paintings full of sparkling colour and light, which give the viewer purely aesthetic pleasure, the most interesting.  Original organization of colours and plastic shapes generates sensual pleasure natural for art. Colour, which is free from real shapes and has independent expressive value, plays here the most important role. The colour in the works of Alexander Vasilevich carries important meaning, it revives, acquires special life force, shows unlimited creative potential.</p> 
   <p>The author tends to maximum use of coloristic power of art. Being master of painting techniques allows expressing the essence through hooliganism with voiced and bright colours, impulsiveness, playing with sense, overcoming conventionalism. Vasilevich is able to be different, going beyond the strict rules and laws of certain kind, genre and style of art.</p>  
  <p>The author`s painting is characterized with professionalism and high artistic taste, harmonious correlation of form and content. In spite of the impression that paintings have been made in one breath with the quick movement of brush on canvas, you feel presence of a solid preparation such as drawing, idea, complex composition beyond apparent ease. Series of works “Venice”, Belarusian landscapes, women`s and children`s images impress greatly.</p> 
   <p>Graphics and colour portraits of the author deserve special attention. Serious and critical viewer will definitely notice mastery of Alexander as a portraitist, keen expert of emotions, facial expression and character.</p>    
   <p>Painting is a subtle poetry of colour and philosophy, understandable in all world`s languages. Every new work is a small discovery for the viewer.</p>
    <p>Beyond the painting you can see the author, his attitude to the world, temperament, mood. Alexander Vasilevich becomes recognizable as an artist thanks to his coloring, emotionality, original presentation and realization technique. Richness of images, bold brush possession, bright palette of colours, expression are summed up into special sign graphic system, which makes the artist popular."</p><br>                                                                                             <p>Art critic Alla Matuk</p>
